# Catan Multiplayer

App will start by just tracking cards drawn and players will manage their own boards over Zoom/etc. Over time will try to develop into a fully funtional multiplayer game. Currently app tracks development cards and resource cards only.

This is not intended to replace the board game or the computer game, but rather to allow players who own the game to be able to play together online.

I do not own any rights to Catan and do not intend to share this publicly or try to make any kind of profit.
